# A **tool to continue playing music even with the lid closed on your MacBook**  
  
## Feature roadmap:  
- [ ] Add sleep timer  
- [ ] Monitoring specific apps within Now playing  
- [x] Add support for [Spotube](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev) and other apps not having `player state` feature  
- [x]  Turn of display and turn on low power mode to save battery when lid is closed  
- [x]  Play music with lid closed  
  
  
  
PS: The code might look a bit messy now. I’ll tidy up later, currently busy with exams.  
  
# Installation  
  
* Download the first beta release [here](https://github.com/Swapnil-Pradhan/LidMusic/releases/tag/LidMusic).  
* When you open the app for the first time, you will get this warning. Click on ‘Done’. Don’t worry this app is safe. This warning shows up because I don’t have a paid Apple Developer account. (yea I’m broke)
