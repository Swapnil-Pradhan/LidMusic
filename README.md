# A **tool to continue playing music even with the lid closed on your MacBook**

## Feature roadmap:

- [ ] Add sleep timer
- [ ] Monitoring specific apps with Now playing
- [x] Add support for [Spotube](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev) and other apps not having `player state` feature
- [x] Turn of display and turn on low power mode to save battery when lid is closed
- [x] Play music with lid closed

Install the first beta release [here](https://github.com/Swapnil-Pradhan/LidMusic/releases/tag/LidMusic).

PS: The code might look a bit messy now. Iâ€™ll tidy up later, currently busy with exams.
